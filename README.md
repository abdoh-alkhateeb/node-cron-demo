# Node Cron Demo

This is a simple demo that sets up an Express.js server with an API endpoint that returns a current weather summary. It demonstrates how to integrate external APIs using fetch and async/await and how to keep the data up-to-date using node-cron.

The server periodically fetches weather data from the Open-Meteo API (free for non-commercial use) and caches it for quick access. This showcases how to schedule regular tasks in Node.js and integrate third-party APIs efficiently.
